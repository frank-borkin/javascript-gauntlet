Story:

Once there was a great Wizard called Ezera, a creator of powerful new spells. One day, something went wrong and he accidently created a portal to another dimension and monsters came pouring through. He called his friends: Mettle, the Barbarian Warrior, King, the Demigod and Jackson, the only Good Daemon to close the portals and save the world from terrors beyond.
Our heros begin in the forest, on their way to find the central portal and shut it down.
